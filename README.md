# e-commerce-code-with-project
Developed a basic e-commerce website that allows users to view products, register/login, add items to a cart, and place orders. Admin can add, update, and delete products. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and PHP with MySQL for the back-end.
